My personal portfolio website developed using React.js. This website features more than 60 projects ranging across various contexts such as professional, personal, and coursework. The website was created as a way for me to convey my project experience to management and recruiters, so the features were built with them in mind.

Each project is displayed as a card across a horizontal timeline-like container with a thumbnail image, a viewable README.md, a link to the actual repository in GitHub, and a Live Demo link (if available). The projects rendered to the timeline can be filtered and sorted by the user.

The website uses GitHub's API to display a user interface for most of the public projects on my GitHub profile. The UI allows users to filter projects by context, competency, language, and/or tool. Projects can also be sorted by date created, date updated, and cumulative file size. Each filter features a dropdown that renders a word cloud that serves as both a means of selecting the desired filter, but also to visualize the number and proportion of content on my GitHub profile (note: the wordcloud only renders on screens of appropriate size). The filters can be compounded or removed by selecting multiple options.
